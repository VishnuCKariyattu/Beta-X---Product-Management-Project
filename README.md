The Babson Entrepreneurial Thought & Action Experience, or BETA-X, is a transformative project-based learning initiative where MBA students collaborate in teams to propose and refine entrepreneurial ventures. Spanning 14 weeks, BETA-X operates independently of any particular class but is deeply interconnected with the core courses students are taking simultaneously. As they progress, teams draw upon insights from eight diverse disciplines—ranging from strategy and marketing to business analytics—gaining a comprehensive understanding of how each field contributes to developing a successful business venture. This integrative approach allows students to apply theoretical knowledge directly to their projects, enhancing both their academic experience and the practical execution of their entrepreneurial ideas. Each course is thoughtfully designed to include exercises and assignments that directly inform and enrich the BETA-X project, creating a robust, hands-on learning environment that bridges theory with real-world application.
